            But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day<br>
            is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as<br>
            one day.<br>

        <p>
            And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim,<br>
            that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its<br>
            times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution<br>
            was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning,<br>
            it being one thousand years according to the time appointed<br>
            unto that whereon thou standest. This is the reckoning of the<br>
            Lord's time, according to the reckoning of Kolob.<br>
